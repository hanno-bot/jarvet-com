## THE PAIN

Even visionary leaders can struggle with rapid market shifts and internal resistance, risking obsolescence in a fast-changing business world.

Traditional consulting models often rely on outdated, one-size-fits-all strategies and over-complicated frameworks, consuming excessive time and resources without addressing the unique challenges and dynamic nature of your business.

### Pain Point 1: Rapid Market Shifts
Rapid changes in the market, including technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors, can outpace an organization's ability to adapt. Companies may find themselves unable to compete effectively, losing market share to more agile competitors who are better attuned to current trends.

### Pain Point 2: Internal Resistance
Resistance to change within an organization, whether due to cultural inertia, fear of the unknown, or lack of alignment among team members, can significantly slow down or even derail strategic initiatives. This resistance leads to missed opportunities, decreased employee morale, and an inability to implement necessary changes, resulting in stagnation or decline in business performance.

### Pain Point 3: Difficulty in Achieving Impactful Turnarounds
The complexity of orchestrating a successful strategic turnaround, especially under tight time constraints, poses a significant challenge. This includes aligning various parts of the organization, reallocating resources, and reassessing business models. Without a clear and effective strategy, turnarounds may lack focus and impact, leading to wasted resources, confusion within the organization, and ultimately, failure to achieve the desired transformation.

## IMPLICATIONS

**The high price of ineffective strategies**

In today's competitive business landscape, relying on outdated or generic strategic solutions can be a costly misstep. Here's what sticking with conventional methods might be costing you:

### Extended Timeframes
Traditional consulting approaches can drag on, taking twice as long to implement with uncertain outcomes. This delay not only slows down progress but also means lost opportunities and revenue as market dynamics continue to evolve.

### Quality of Outcomes
Conventional strategies often lack customization and fail to align with your specific business needs and market context. This one-size-fits-all approach results in suboptimal solutions that don't fully address your unique challenges, leading to mediocre results and hindered growth.

### Misallocated Resources
Time is a valuable asset, and spending it on ineffective strategic planning is a significant waste. Instead of focusing on core business activities and growth opportunities, leaders are bogged down by cumbersome and unproductive strategic processes.

### Opportunity Costs
While you're tied up with ineffective strategies, your competitors who adopt more agile and tailored approaches might be capturing market share, innovating, and moving ahead.

### Stress and Frustration
Dealing with the inefficiencies of outdated strategic methods adds unnecessary stress and diverts your attention from critical business decisions and leadership responsibilities.

## TESTIMONIALS

### Regina Raukas, Chairman of the Executive Board, Tallinna Jaatmete Taaskasutuskeskus AS
"Hanno helped us to arrive at the core challenge in our strategy very quickly and was able to lead us to our core insights rapidly. He helped map our current environment, possible strategic scenarios and threats. We agreed on alternative courses of action and further directions to develop in more detail. His insights and perspective were valuable in getting us to this point in record time."

### Ivo Lille, Head Master, Georg Ots Tallinn Music College
"The Georg Ots Tallinn Music College needed set a new strategy to move to a more student outcome focused organisation. Hanno helped us to agree on a strategic focus and to turn our organisation in a new direction in record time. An outside expert gave us the perspective to look at our organisation and its role in the society in a novel way and gave me the opportunity to adjust my own role throughout the process. His expertise and guidance helped us to focus on the critical issues of our process and got us to results faster, with more confidence and less stress. The positive changes that I see in the behaviors and attitudes of our people have taken root and have lead to a host of new services and international opportunities. Compared with our peers, the school has been able to conduct changes at an unprecedented speed and is currently serving as an exemplar to others."

### Kristjan Tozen, CEO, Krakul, Estonia's leading product development consultancy
"Hanno is... something else. His unique charisma, deep industry knowledge, no-bullshit mentality, and endless analogies & idioms guides you towards the right solution without giving you an answer straight away. To be honest, I don't think Hanno knows all the answers, but he does know to ask the right questions and is more than willing to go on a journey with you to seek out the answers together. True partner that any enterprise would benefit from -- does it with you not for you (unless that's what you truly need), which has a larger ROI in the long run. Hanno helped us at Krakul to redefine our value proposition. Being in a service & consulting business you need to have the right mindset and be focused on maximizing the value to the end customer. We went from just providing the engineering services to being technology partners for many of our clients, mainly because of Hanno's guidance, vision and mantra. He helped our development teams to be more agile and efficient (but not too efficient!), our management to develop a strategy for a better fee system, our sales to have more focused sales pitches and find the economic buyer, and our marketing to have a more streamlined and direct approach to finding new leads. 10/10 would recommend!"

### Priit Kongo, Founder, Net Group
"As a result of our cooperation we have markedly improved our profitability, revenue and moved further up the value chain. Changes in our strategy, marketing, sales and delivery have resulted in both significantly improved customer outcomes and employee satisfaction. We are now have deeper relationships with our customers and are making a bigger impact on their bottom lines in more countries and industries."

### Mikko Prii, Founder and CEO of Begin.eu
"Partnering with Hanno and his team for the Strategic Turnaround Blueprint was a game-changer for our organization. In just a short period, we saw profound changes in our strategic approach, which translated into measurable business results. The level of personalization and attention to detail in understanding our unique challenges was exceptional. This isn't just another consulting service; it's a transformative experience that redefines the way you look at your business and its potential. If you're on the fence about this, I urge you to take the leap -- it's an investment in your organization's future that pays off manifold."
