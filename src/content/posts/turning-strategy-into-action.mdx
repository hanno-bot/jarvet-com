summary: "Most strategies fail not because they are wrong, but because they never leave the slide deck. Here is how to bridge the gap between strategic intent and operational reality."

Every leader has experienced it: a well-crafted strategy that somehow never gains traction. The workshops were productive, the slides were polished, and the board was aligned — yet six months later, nothing has meaningfully changed.

## The Execution Gap

The problem is rarely the strategy itself. It is the space between intent and action — what I call the execution gap. This gap exists because most strategic plans describe *where* to go without adequately addressing *how* to get there within the constraints of your current reality.

Wardley Mapping helps close this gap by making the landscape visible. When you can see the terrain, you can plot a route — not just a destination.

## Three Principles for Action

**1. Start with situational awareness.** Before deciding what to do, understand where you are. Map your value chains, identify what is evolving, and recognize where you are competing on inertia rather than insight.

**2. Make small, reversible bets.** Grand transformations sound impressive in annual reports but they carry enormous risk. Instead, identify the smallest meaningful moves that shift your position and validate your assumptions.

**3. Build feedback loops.** Strategy is not a one-time event. The organizations that execute best are the ones that continuously sense, adapt, and adjust. Build the discipline of regular strategic review into your operating rhythm.

## The Bottom Line

Strategy without execution is just aspiration. The leaders who win are the ones who treat strategy as a living practice — something they do continuously, not something they produce once a year.

If your strategy is gathering dust, it might be time to rethink not the plan, but the process.
